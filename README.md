# skills

Personal OpenClaw skills monorepo.

## Layout
- Each skill lives in its own folder at the repo root.
- Symlink the skill folder into `~/.openclaw/extensions/<skill-name>` when you want it active.

## Notes
- Keep skills small and composable.
- Prefer deterministic scripts and pin dependencies where possible.
